<body>
	<p>Hello! My name is Taran, but you can call me Tay. I am a 26 year old furry on the internet who was to lazy to make a proper site!</p>
	<p>The weird thing is that this site is hosted on a powerful VPS (Virtal Private Server), with a good domain name! The website might be better one day! I mean I pay 40 dollars a month, so I might... not want to waste this.</p>
	<p>I actually know a lot of technology related matters, like Server Administration, Backend Development and Machine Learning Research, witch a touch of engineering. But this is just stuff I do online, I have a life.</p>

	<h4>Stuff I currently do online (click on any item for more info):</h4>
	<ul>
		<li onclick="changeMessage('fusion')">C++/Assembly Server Developer for Fusion Fall</li>
		<li onclick="changeMessage('hypixel')">Hypixel Pit Mod Developer (IDK the name of it yet)</li>
		<li onclick="changeMessage('youtube')">Making shitty YouTube Videos on Hypickel</li>
		<li onclick="changeMessage('vrchat')">Chronic VRChat player</li>
		<li onclick="changeMessage('sea')">Sea of Thieves Milsim LOVER (Yarrrr he's a pirate!)</li>
		<li onclick="changeMessage('blackspigot')"><b>SOON:</b> Blackspigot Staff Member</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p id="infoText">Click on any item in the list above to learn more about it!</p>
	
	<p>Well, that's about it! Hopefully my website was OK at best :3</p>
