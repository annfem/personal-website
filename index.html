			<!--<p>The weird thing is that this site is hosted on a powerful VPS (Virtal Private Server), with a good domain name! The website might be better one day! I mean I pay 40 dollars a month, so I might... not want to waste this.</p>-->
			<p>I actually know a lot of technology related matters, like Server Administration, Backend Development and Machine Learning Research, witch a touch of engineering. But this is just stuff I do online, I have a life.</p>

			<h4>Stuff I currently do online (click on any item for more info):</h4>

				<li onclick="changeMessage('hypixel')">Hypixel Pit Mod Developer (IDK the name of it yet)</li>
				<li onclick="changeMessage('youtube')">Making shitty YouTube Videos on Hypickel</li>
